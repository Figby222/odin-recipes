        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta is one of the simplest yet tastiest dishes that anyone can make!
        For this recipe, you may choose any shape of pasta you please, but we decided
        to choose spaghetti. If you are vegan, you may enjoy this dish as well,
        as instead of butter, you can use an equal portion of olive oil, and it will
        taste just as good!</p>
